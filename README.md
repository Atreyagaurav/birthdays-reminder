# Birthdays Reminder

## About
This program simply scans a file with birthdays informations and then displays the list with number before the next birthday.

compile with gcc, then use -h option for help.

## Aknowledgement
The BS and AD conversion codes are copied and slightly modified from the [Bipul Panthi's Repository](https://github.com/bpanthi977/calendar). Without it, I'd not have been able to support the BS date format. 

As for the idea, I nearly forgot the birthday of my friend, so some credit goes to him.
