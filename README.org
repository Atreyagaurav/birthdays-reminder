** Aknowledgement
The BS and AD conversion codes are copied and slightly modified from the [[https://github.com/bpanthi977/calendar][Bipul Panthi's Repository]]. Without it, I'd not have been able to support the BS date format. 

As for the idea, I nearly forgot the birthday of my friend, so some credit goes to him.
